### User Authentication Implementation - 2024-01-15

**Outcome:** Success  
**Confidence:** High  
**Time:** 4h estimated vs 6h actual

**What Went Well:**
- Supabase auth integration was straightforward
- Component structure was clean and reusable
- Error handling covered edge cases

**Challenges:**
- Session persistence took longer than expected
- Had to refactor the auth context twice

**Root Cause:**
Didn't fully read Supabase docs before starting. Assumed behavior based on other auth libraries.

**Key Lesson:**
Always read official docs for new integrations before coding.

**Apply to Future:**
Add "Read docs" as first step in any integration task.

**Pattern Identified:**
- [x] Add to successes.md (auth component structure)
- [ ] Add to mistakes.md
