<!-- 
GUIDELINES FOR GOOD REFLECTIONS:

1. Be Specific
   ❌ "It was hard"
   ✅ "The async state management was complex because of race conditions"

2. Be Actionable
   ❌ "Should do better next time"
   ✅ "Next time, add loading states before implementing fetch logic"

3. Identify Patterns
   ❌ "Fixed the bug"
   ✅ "This is the 3rd time null checks were missing - add to component template"

4. Connect to Future
   ❌ "Learned something"
   ✅ "When user asks for 'real-time', always clarify: polling vs websockets vs SSE"
