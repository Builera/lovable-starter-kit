### In Progress 🔄

- [ ] None currently

### Blocked 🚫

- None

### Learnings 📚

- Lovable AI doesn't auto-read files; must use Project Knowledge for enforcement
- Boot instruction should be concise (~200 words) for reliable execution
- Versioning helps track OS evolution and enables rollback
- Filled examples reduce friction more than empty templates
- Validation scripts catch missing files before they cause issues
- Metrics provide data-driven insights for process improvement
