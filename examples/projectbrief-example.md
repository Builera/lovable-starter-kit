# Project Brief — TaskFlow Pro

> This is a **filled example** of projectbrief.md for reference.

---

## What is this project?

TaskFlow Pro is a modern task management web application designed for small development teams. It combines Kanban-style boards with time tracking and sprint planning capabilities. The app allows teams to visualize their workflow, track time spent on tasks, and generate productivity reports. Built as a SaaS product with a freemium model.

## Why does it exist?

Development teams often struggle with fragmented tooling—using separate apps for task management, time tracking, and reporting. This creates context switching overhead and makes it difficult to get a unified view of team productivity. TaskFlow Pro consolidates these features into a single, elegant interface designed specifically for developers who value keyboard shortcuts and efficiency.

## Who is it for?

- **Primary users:** Small development teams (3-10 people) at startups and agencies
- **Secondary users:** Freelance developers managing multiple client projects
- **Buyer persona:** Tech leads and engineering managers who make tooling decisions
